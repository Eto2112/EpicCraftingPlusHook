# EpicCraftingsRequireItemHook

A lightweight Minecraft plugin that enhances EpicCraftingsPlus by allowing players to click on require items in crafting recipes to open their respective crafting menus.

## üìã Requirements

- **Minecraft**: 1.20.1+
- **Server**: Paper/Spigot
- **Java**: 17+
- **Dependencies**:
  - EpicCraftingsPlus (required)
  - MMOItems (optional, for enhanced NBT reading)


## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

### Click Handling
When a player clicks on a require item slot (10-13, 19-22, 28-31):
- Plugin detects the current recipe from the result item
- Looks up configured commands for that recipe and slot position
- Executes the commands to open the appropriate crafting menu

## üîß Configuration

### Basic Setup

```yaml
# config.yml
version: 1.1

items-command:
  # MMOItems ID (UPPERCASE)
  BICHNHA:
    1: '[console] ecraft opencraft %player_name% phongan'
    2: '[console] ecraft opencraft %player_name% trai_tim_linh_bien'
  
  BANGTHANKIEM:
    1: '[console] ecraft opencraft %player_name% bang_tinh_loc'
    2: '[console] ecraft opencraft %player_name% bang_than_kiem1'

# Slot mapping (position -> inventory slot)
slot-mapping:
  positions:
    1: 10    # First require item
    2: 11    # Second require item
    3: 12    # Third require item
    4: 13    # Fourth require item
    # ... up to position 12
```
### Command Types

- `[console]` - Execute as console
- `[player]` - Execute as player
- `[message]` - Send message to player
- `[op]` - Execute as player with temporary OP
